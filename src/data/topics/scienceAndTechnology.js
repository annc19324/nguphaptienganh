Câu tường thuật là gì?\n\nCâu tường thuật (Reported Speech) hay còn gọi là câu gián tiếp, được sử dụng để thuật lại lời nói của người khác mà vẫn giữ nguyên nội dung gốc. Khi chuyển sang dạng này, lời nói không còn được đặt trong dấu ngoặc kép như trong câu trực tiếp.\n\n**Ví dụ:**\n\nCâu trực tiếp: Tom said, “I don’t like coffee.”\n→ Câu tường thuật: Tom said that he didn’t like coffee.\n\nCâu trực tiếp: She said, “I am tired.”\n→ Câu tường thuật: She said that she was tired.\n\n## 2. Các bước chuyển từ lời nói trực tiếp sang gián tiếp\n\n### a. Đổi chủ ngữ, tân ngữ\n\n| Lời nói trực tiếp | Lời nói gián tiếp |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Đại từ nhân xưng** | |\n| I | He/ she |\n| We | They |\n| You | I/ we, he, she |\n| **Tính từ sở hữu** | |\n| My | His/ her |\n| Our | Their |\n| Your | My |\n| **Đại từ sở hữu** | |\n| Mine | His/ hers |\n| Ours | Their |\n| Yours | Mine |\n| **Đại từ tân ngữ** | |\n| Me | Him/ her |\n| Us | Them |\n| You | Me/ him/ her |\n\n### b. Chuyển thời động từ\n\nThông thường ta chỉ lùi thì khi động từ giới thiệu *say, tell, ask, etc.* chia ở thời quá khứ đơn. Không lùi thời khi các động từ trên chia ở hiện tại đơn.\n\nQuy tắc lùi thời được tóm gọn trong bảng sau:\n\n| Lời nói trực tiếp | Lời nói gián tiếp |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Hiện tại đơn** (S + Vs/es) | **Quá khứ đơn** (S + Ved) |\n| **Hiện tại tiếp diễn** (S + is/am/are + Ving) | **Quá khứ tiếp diễn** (S + was/were + Ving) |\n| **Hiện tại hoàn thành** (S + has/ have + PII) | **Quá khứ hoàn thành** (S + had + PII) |\n| **Quá khứ đơn** (S + Ved) | **Quá khứ hoàn thành** (S + had + PII) |\n| **Quá khứ tiếp diễn** (S + was/ were + Ving) | **Quá khứ hoàn thành tiếp diễn** (S + had been + Ving) |\n| **Quá khứ hoàn thành** (S + had + PII) | *Giữ nguyên* |\n| **Tương lai đơn** (S + will + V) | S + **would** V |\n| **Tương lai gần** (S + am/ is/ are + going to V) | **Was/ were** + going to V |\n| **Must** | **Had to** |\n| **Can** | **Could** |\n| **May** | **Might** |\n| **Câu điều kiện loại I** | **Câu điều kiện loại II** |\n\n### c. Trạng từ chỉ thời gian, nơi chốn\n\n| Trực tiếp | Gián tiếp |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Tomorrow | The next day / the following day |\n| Yesterday | The day before / the previous day |\n| Last + danh từ thời gian | The previous + danh từ thời gian / The + danh từ thời gian + before |\n| Next + danh từ thời gian | The following + danh từ thời gian / The next + danh từ thời gian |\n| This | That |\n| These | Those |\n| Here | There |\n| Now | Then |\n| Today | That day |\n| Ago | Before |\n\n## 3. Cách chuyển sang câu gián tiếp với từng loại câu cụ thể\n\n### ⮚ Câu trần thuật\n\nVới câu trần thuật, ta chỉ cần viết lại động từ giới thiệu, sau đó chuyển đổi chủ ngữ, lùi thời của động từ chính, và thay đổi trạng ngữ (nếu có) theo bảng đã nêu ở phần I.\n\n**CẤU TRÚC:**\n\n“S1 + V”, S2 said.\n\n⇒ S2 + said to sb/ told sb/ explained to sb/ complained to sb/ announced/ thought/ believed + that S1 + V (lùi thời)\n\n**Ví dụ:**\n\n“We are having a meeting here now.”, the secretary said.\n⇒ The secretary said that they were having a meeting there then.\n"
